## 📊 Data Science Explorations with Seaborn Datasets

Welcome to my **Data Science Playground 🎉**
This repository contains my **exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights** using Seaborn’s classic datasets.

---

## ✅ Datasets Covered
- 🚗 Taxis (Fare and factors influencing fare)
- 💎 Diamonds (Price and characteristics)  
- 🚑 Health Expectancy (Country wise health expectancy)
  
---

### 🚕 Taxis Dataset
**Goal**: Understand ride patterns, trip costs, and passenger behaviors.

**🔍 Key Highlights:**
- Analyzed trip distances, fares, and tips.
- Explored relationships between pickup/drop-off times & earnings.
- Visualized peak hours for rides using time-based plots.
- Discovered trends in driver performance & passenger tipping behavior.

### 💎 Diamonds Dataset
**Goal**: Explore how carat, cut, color, and clarity influence diamond prices.

**🔍 Key Highlights:**
- Investigated the price vs carat relationship (non-linear growth).
- Compared diamond quality categories (cut, color, clarity) against price.
- Built correlation heatmaps to uncover strong predictors of diamond value.
- Visualized distributions with histograms & KDE plots.

### 🌍 Health Expectancy Dataset
**Goal**: Explore global life expectancy & health trends.

**🔍 Key Highlights:**
- Compared life expectancy across regions and income groups.
- Visualized links between GDP, healthcare, and life expectancy.
- Identified countries with highest/lowest longevity.
- Time-series trends showing improvements in global health.
